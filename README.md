# dsnt-scripts

dsnt-scripts is a collection of tools for building a Dissonant system, and creating packages. They are known to work correctly on a ghostlinux host and using the ghost temporary toolchain. They should also work correctly in a Dissonant system. All other systems, user beware.

If you want to use a different host system, be aware that using dash as your shell will cause your system to crash and burn.
Always use bash!

Some utilities may be configured differently on other systems, so when in doubt, assume that dsnt-scripts will use the GNU
usage of a command.
